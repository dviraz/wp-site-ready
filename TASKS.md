# Tasks

Persistent task list for this repo. Use these sections to track work across Codex sessions so tasks donâ€™t disappear when the CLI restarts.

- [ ] Add doc: local vs prod API behavior (relative paths)
- [ ] Optional: add Playwright smoke test for /shop and ROI add-to-cart
- [ ] Add items here. Example template:

## Done
- [2025-09-08] Add persistent TASKS.md to track work
- [2025-09-08] Route WooCommerce API via Vercel `/wp-json/wc/v3` in production; keep localhost proxy in dev
- [2025-09-08] Update cart sync base URL to match prod/dev logic
- [2025-09-08] Rebuild static output to `public/`

- [2025-09-08] Verify add-to-cart via deep links is working

Guidelines
- Use short, imperative titles (e.g., "Implement ROI range validation").
- Move items between sections instead of deleting.
- When completing, copy the title to Done with a date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- If you want Codex to mirror the current plan here, just say: "mirror plan to TASKS.md".
