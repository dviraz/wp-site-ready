## Executive Summary

The MarketBoost marketing platform presents a professional and visually appealing interface with good performance characteristics. However, several critical issues prevent it from functioning as intended, primarily stemming from broken backend integration and navigation inconsistencies.

**Overall Score: 6/10**

## Conclusion

The MarketBoost site has excellent visual design and good performance foundations, but suffers from critical backend integration issues that prevent core e-commerce functionality. The primary focus should be on fixing the routing and API connections to restore intended functionality.

With proper backend integration and navigation fixes, this could be a highly effective marketing platform. The current state, however, prevents users from accessing services or completing purchases, making it unsuitable for production use.

**Next Steps:**
1. Priority focus on navigation and backend integration
2. Implement proper testing environment
3. Establish CI/CD pipeline for reliable deployments
4. Create comprehensive test suite for ongoing quality assurance
